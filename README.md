# Hello

I'm AbstractUmbra. No idea why you're looking here, but here goes:

## Bio
My day job is a DevSecOps Engineer, with a specialty in Cryptographic Security. Since you see "Dev" and "Ops" here, you can assume I'm currently using and proficient at Docker, K8s and Helm.

## Skillset

This is a huge WIP, but here is my skillset. If you have any suggestions please feel free to contact me using the email provided on my profile.

| Languages | Skill level |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Python** | Proficient |
| **Rust** | Minimal and improving |
| **Go** | Nonexistent. Bad DevOps guy here. |
| Not a lang, but **Shell** | Proficient |

## Work/Projects

A number of my projects are currently closed source until I'm a stage where ~~I won't be roasted~~ am comfortable with the quality of them, not much of a portfolio but I promise I'm good at what I do.
