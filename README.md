# Hello

I'm AbstractUmbra. No idea why you're looking here, but here goes:

## Bio
My day job is a DevSecOps Engineer, with a specialty in Cryptographic Security. Since you see "Dev" and "Ops" here, you can assume I'm currently using and proficient at Docker, K8s and Helm.

Been an avid Python programmer since December 2018 and I rather enjoy the language. However I think my new true love is Rust, so expect a lot of that in my future.

## Skillset

This is a large WIP, but here is my skillset. If you have any suggestions please feel free to contact me using the email provided on my profile, or with the 'feedback' button.

| Languages | Skill level |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Python** | Proficient |
| **Rust** | Minimal and improving |
| Not a lang, but **Shell** | Proficient |

## Work/Projects

A number of my projects are currently closed source until I'm a stage where I ~~won't be roasted~~ am comfortable with the quality of them, not much of a portfolio but I promise I'm good at what I do.

Looking to contrib on Rust/Python projects, if you want some bad jokes in your commit messages.
